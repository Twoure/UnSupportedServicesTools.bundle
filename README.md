UnSupported Services Tools
==========================

This is a plugin that creates a new channel in [Plex Media Server](https://plex.tv/) (PMS) to manage the installation and update of the [UnSupportedServices.bundle](https://github.com/Twoure/UnSupportedServices.bundle) (USS).  The intent of this channel is to keep a clean install of the _UnSupportedServices.bundle_ inbetween updates.

> Note: This channel/plugin is in beta testing phase, and may not work across all platforms.
